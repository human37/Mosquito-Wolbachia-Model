QUICK OVERVIEW:
This program models disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans.
The disease choosen for this model is the Dengue virus.
In order to run the program, install dependencies, and run 'gui.py'

ABSTRACT:
Dengue fever is one of the most common mosquito-borne infections, 
and it is commonly spread in tropical climates. 
It can only be spread from the bite of a female Aedes aegypti mosquito. 
Wolbachia is a natural bacteria found in around 60% of all mosquito species, 
but it is not found naturally in the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the mosquito primarily responsible for the spread of Dengue virus. 
By infecting the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Wolbachia, 
it will slow the growth of any viruses the mosquito may carry, including Dengue. 
We developed a temperature-dependent mathematical model to predict the spread of the Dengue virus between mosquitoes and humans. 
Moreover, our simulation shows the optimal range of temperature as well as what times during the year,
Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes should be released in order to be as cost-effective as possible. 
Furthermore, we designed a robust GUI that could be used by mosquito abatement centers,
in order to determine optimal strategies to most efficiently mitigate the disease outbreaks.

PERCENTAGES FOR THE GRAPHS:
The number is the percentage of wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to add to the population. 
They are only added when the weekly average temperature is between 29 and 32.5 degrees celsius. 

ALSO:
This program is still under development, any input would be desired.
